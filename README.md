# **Snake**

**Snake Game written in [Python](https://www.python.org) built using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news).**

The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food, trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult.
